# Learning how to learn

------

This project is a combination of parts 1 & 2 of our Advanced HTML & CSS sprint at Practicum by Yandex. In this project, we cover flexbox, advanced HTML & CSS capabilities, BEM methodology, positioning, animations, embeds, forms, and advanced git concepts.

I love everything about this project since it features some of my favorite resources I've used in my engineering/webdev learning journey. A Mind for Numbers is a book that got me through Calculus 1-3. Tim Urban confirmed that I'm not the only one that procrastinates & Salman Khan's Academy probably single-handedly got me through high school and college.

Note to reviewer @ Practicum:

Thanks for the Need Improvement notes! I haven't implemented them since we're so close to the hard deadline and I don't want to risk anything breaking/requiring additional fixing, but I will try implementing them later when the pressure is off.
